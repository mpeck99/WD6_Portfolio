# WD6_Portfolio

## This repo is creating an E-Commerce site with a cart. 
This project I was to create an E-Commerce site in NodeJS / The MEAN Stack and implement my own feature of my choice. I was to redesign the splash/landing page  which I did by including a carousel to display some of sites products up for sale. This project you are able to add and remove products to a shopping cart as well as checkout. Currently the checkout portion is only in test mode and can be tested with the following card information: 

Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242 <br />
Date: Any Valid Expiration Date <br />
CVV: Any CVV Code <br />

The checkout portion is done with implementing the StripJS into the project allowing you to capture ones card. 
There is also a wish list feature which allows the user to add any items they wish to a list so that they are able to purchase them later. To access the wishlist as well as to checkout the user must signup/login to do any of those actions.
